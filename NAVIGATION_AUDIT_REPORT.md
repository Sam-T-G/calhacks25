# Deep Navigation Audit Report

## Issues Found

### Issue #1: Incorrect Data Channel Event Name

**Problem:** Using `room.on("dataReceived")` but LiveKit SDK may use different event name
**File:** `src/components/VoiceAssistant.tsx:282`
**Fix:** Use `room.on(f.RoomEvent.DataReceived)` or check SDK docs

### Issue #2: Agent Override Method Not Called

**Problem:** `on_chat_received` method may not be the correct override name for Agent class
**File:** `voice-agent/agent.py:148`
**Evidence:** Cannot find `on_chat_received` in LiveKit agents docs
**Fix:** Use proper Agent callback method

### Issue #3: No Event Handler Registration

**Problem:** `room.on()` needs event name as first param - verifying correct syntax
**File:** `src/components/VoiceAssistant.tsx:282`
**Fix:** Verify correct event name from LiveKit SDK

### Issue #4: Missing Console Logs for Debugging

**Problem:** No logs to verify data is being sent/received
**Fix:** Add extensive logging throughout the flow

### Issue #5: Potential Timing Issue

**Problem:** Navigation happens while voice interface is still processing
**File:** Multiple files
**Fix:** Ensure navigation waits for data channel to be ready

## Testing Steps

1. Check browser console for any errors
2. Verify data channel events in network tab
3. Add debug logs to track message flow
4. Test if Claude is actually being called
5. Verify JSON parsing is working

## Proposed Fixes

1. Fix data channel event listening
2. Use correct Agent callback methods
3. Add comprehensive logging
4. Add error handling for data transmission
5. Test end-to-end flow
