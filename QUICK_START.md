# Quick Start Guide

## Get Started in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file (optional but recommended)
echo "VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env
```

Get your API key from: https://console.anthropic.com/

### Step 2: Run (1 command)

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will open at http://localhost:3000

### Step 3: Test Features

1. **Navigate to "Serve" section**

   - Activities are automatically generated
   - Click "Refresh" to generate new ones

2. **Test Photo Verification**
   - Click camera icon üì∑ on any activity
   - Take a photo with your device
   - Click checkmark ‚úì to verify
   - Earn XP if verified!

## Without API Key?

No problem! The app works without an API key:

- Uses pre-defined mock activities
- Photo verification runs in demo mode
- Everything else works the same

## Enable Personalization (Optional)

Edit `src/config/userPreferences.ts`:

```typescript
export const userPreferences: UserPreferences = {
	interests: ["environment", "education", "animals"],
	location: "Your City, State",
	causes: ["Climate Action", "Youth Programs"],
};
```

Activities will be personalized to your interests!
