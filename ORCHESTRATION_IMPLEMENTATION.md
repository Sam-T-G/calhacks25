# Claude Voice Orchestration Pipeline - Implementation Complete âœ…

## Summary

Successfully implemented a complete voice orchestration system where Claude acts as the brain that analyzes voice transcripts and controls navigation, actions, and UI updates throughout the DoGood app.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend API (`api/claude.js`) âœ…

- Added `orchestrate` action to existing Claude endpoint
- Created `buildOrchestrationRequest()` function
- Created `buildOrchestrationPrompt()` with comprehensive system instructions
- Claude returns structured JSON with:
  - Intent detection
  - Navigation commands
  - Action triggers
  - UI updates
  - Context/preference updates
  - Voice responses

### 2. Context Service (`src/services/contextService.ts`) âœ…

- Added `orchestration` activity type
- Implemented `logOrchestration()` method to track orchestration events
- Implemented `getTranscriptForClaude()` to format conversation history

### 3. Voice Agent (`voice-agent/agent.py`) âœ…

- Added conversation history tracking
- Implemented intent detection with keyword matching
- Created `orchestrate_with_claude()` method to call backend API
- Created `send_command_to_frontend()` using LiveKit data channel
- Added `on_chat_received()` override to trigger orchestration on-demand
- Integrated httpx for async HTTP calls to backend

### 4. Frontend - VoiceAssistant (`src/components/VoiceAssistant.tsx`) âœ…

- Added `onNavigate` and `onExecuteAction` props
- Implemented `handleClaudeCommand()` to process commands from voice agent
- Added data channel listener using LiveKit's `useRoomContext`
- Integrated toast notifications for UI updates
- Connected to contextService for preference updates

### 5. App-Level Orchestration (`src/App.tsx`) âœ…

- Created `handleVoiceNavigation()` for section navigation
- Created `executeVoiceAction()` to handle action commands
- Connected VoiceAssistant with navigation and action handlers
- Properly typed all Section references

## Key Features

### Intent Detection (On-Demand)

Keywords that trigger Claude orchestration:

- "show me", "navigate", "take me to"
- "i want to", "help me find", "find me"
- "start", "begin", "can you", "could you"

### Navigation Capabilities

Claude can navigate to any section:

- home
- serve
- productivity
- self-improve
- shop
- stats

### Action Types

Claude can trigger:

- `generate_activities` - Generate service opportunities
- `start_timer` - Start productivity focus timer
- `generate_self_improve` - Generate personal development activities
- `update_preferences` - Update user interests/preferences
- `refresh_activities` - Refresh current section

### UI Updates

- Show toast notifications (success/info/error)
- Open modals
- Highlight elements

## Communication Flow

```
User speaks â†’ LiveKit STT
â†“
OpenAI processes â†’ Detects intent keywords
â†“
Voice Agent calls Claude orchestration API
â†“
Claude analyzes transcript + context â†’ Returns JSON commands
â†“
Voice Agent sends commands via LiveKit data channel
â†“
Frontend receives â†’ Executes navigation/actions/UI updates
â†“
Context Service logs orchestration event
```

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: "Show me volunteering opportunities"

```json
{
	"intent": "find volunteering opportunities",
	"navigation": { "page": "serve" },
	"actions": [{ "type": "generate_activities" }],
	"voice_response": "I'll show you some great volunteering opportunities in your area!",
	"context_updates": {}
}
```

### Example 2: "Start a 25 minute timer for studying"

```json
{
	"intent": "start productivity timer",
	"navigation": { "page": "productivity" },
	"actions": [
		{
			"type": "start_timer",
			"params": { "minutes": 25, "taskName": "studying" }
		}
	],
	"voice_response": "Starting a 25 minute focus timer for studying. Let's get productive!",
	"context_updates": {}
}
```

### Example 3: "I care about the environment"

```json
{
	"intent": "update preferences",
	"voice_response": "I've noted your interest in environmental causes. I'll prioritize those activities for you!",
	"context_updates": {
		"interests": ["environment"],
		"causes": ["environmental"]
	}
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test basic navigation: "Show me volunteering opportunities"
- [ ] Test action triggering: "Start a 25 minute focus timer"
- [ ] Test preference learning: "I'm interested in environmental causes"
- [ ] Test multi-step: "I want to be productive, help me focus"
- [ ] Test context awareness: Mention interests, then ask for activities

## Technical Notes

- Uses LiveKit's data channel for reliable command delivery
- Tracks last 10 conversation exchanges to limit token usage
- Falls back to normal conversation if orchestration fails
- All orchestration events logged to context service
- Works alongside existing OpenAI conversational agent

## Files Modified

1. `/api/claude.js` - Backend orchestration endpoint
2. `/voice-agent/agent.py` - Intent detection and Claude integration
3. `/src/components/VoiceAssistant.tsx` - Data message listener
4. `/src/App.tsx` - Command executor
5. `/src/services/contextService.ts` - Orchestration logging
6. `/src/components/Home.tsx` - Type fixes for Section

## Dependencies

- `httpx` (already in pyproject.toml) - For async HTTP in voice agent
- `sonner` (already in package.json) - For toast notifications

## Ready for Demo! ðŸŽ‰

The orchestration pipeline is complete and ready to test. Simply:

1. Start the voice agent: `cd voice-agent && uv run agent.py dev`
2. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open the app and click "Speak with DoGood Companion"
4. Say phrases like:
   - "Show me volunteering opportunities"
   - "I want to be productive"
   - "Start a 25 minute timer"
   - "I'm interested in helping animals"

Claude will analyze your speech, make decisions, and navigate/control the app accordingly!
