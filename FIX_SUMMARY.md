# Navigation Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Data Channel Event API

**Problem:** Using incorrect event name `"dataReceived"` as string
**Fix:** Changed to use `RoomEvent.DataReceived` enum from livekit-client
**File:** `src/components/VoiceAssistant.tsx`

### ✅ 2. Added Comprehensive Debug Logging

**Problem:** No visibility into data flow
**Fix:** Added detailed console logs throughout the pipeline:

- Voice agent: Data preparation, encoding, sending
- Frontend: Data listener setup, data reception, parsing

## Testing Checklist

To verify the fix works:

1. **Start backend services:**

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   cd voice-agent && uv run agent.py dev

   # Terminal 2
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open browser console** to see debug logs

3. **Click "Speak with DoGood Companion"**

4. **Say a navigation command:**

   - "Show me volunteering opportunities"
   - "Take me to productivity"
   - "I want to help my community"

5. **Watch console for:**

   - `[VoiceAssistant] Setting up data listener` ✅
   - `[VoiceAssistant] Data listener registered` ✅
   - `[Agent] Successfully sent commands to frontend` ✅
   - `[VoiceAssistant] Data received!` ✅
   - `[VoiceAssistant] Received Claude command:` ✅
   - `[VoiceAssistant] Navigating to: serve` ✅

6. **Expected behavior:**
   - App navigates to the requested section
   - Voice interface stays open
   - Console shows successful data transmission

## Debugging Flow

If navigation doesn't work, check logs in this order:

1. **Voice Agent Logs** (Terminal 1)

   - Look for `Real-time transcript:` - confirms speech received
   - Look for `[Agent] Successfully sent commands` - confirms data sent

2. **Browser Console** (DevTools)

   - Look for `[VoiceAssistant] Data received!` - confirms data received
   - Look for `[VoiceAssistant] Received Claude command:` - confirms parsing
   - Look for `[VoiceAssistant] Navigating to:` - confirms navigation trigger

3. **Network Tab** (DevTools)
   - Check `/api/claude` request
   - Verify Claude returns valid JSON
   - Check response has `navigation` field

## Known Limitations

- `on_chat_received` may not be a valid Agent override method in LiveKit
- If this is the case, we may need to use a different approach like:
  - Hooking into the LLM response directly
  - Using a custom message handler
  - Wrapping the AgentSession callbacks

## Next Steps

If the above doesn't work, we need to:

1. Verify the correct Agent override method in LiveKit docs
2. Test data channel publishing with a simpler message first
3. Check if room connection is fully established before sending data
